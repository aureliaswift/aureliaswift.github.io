this is still a major WIP I'm sorry!! just compiling all the stuff 

For my senior capstone project at UCSC I did 3D modeling on Alone, Not lonely, a mixed 2D and 3D, First Person, Puzzle and Adventure RPG taking place in the Louisiana Bayou.

 You play as Gabriel, a 7 year old child, who wakes up to an empty house in the middle of the night; that becomes not so empty once a mysterious figure is discovered in their attic. Your goal is to follow after this new-found figure through a maze of your own home and imaginary fears; in an effort to find out the figure's true identity, and to escape your overwhelming feelings of loneliness and anxiety. 
 
 I made enviornmental models for all of the different levels in the house as well as modeling and rigging the hands for the player character.
